# Integration Instructions for AI Labor Market Dashboard Fix

This document provides instructions on how to integrate the fixes for the AI Labor Market Dashboard to properly display March 2025 Anthropic Economic Index data instead of falling back to derived/synthetic data.

## Problem Diagnosis

Based on the code analysis and the provided data files, the dashboard is showing "Using derived data based on Anthropic Economic Index" because:

1. The main processed file (`ai_labor_index_latest.json`) contains metadata about the Anthropic Economic Index but lacks the detailed role-level data
2. The job trends file (`job_trends_202504.json`) contains the actual role-level data, but:
   - It's not being properly connected to the dashboard component
   - The file has an incorrect date (202504 instead of 202503)
   - The processing function doesn't handle all possible data structures properly

## Fix Overview

The solution involves three main components:

1. Updating the data fetching code to load the correct job trends file
2. Enhancing the `processRolesDataForSplitBars` function to handle different data formats
3. Fixing the main job role processing logic in the useEffect that processes the data

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update the Data Fetching Logic

1. Open your `AILaborMarketDashboard.jsx` file
2. Find the `useEffect` hook that contains the data fetching logic
3. Replace it with the code from the "Fix useEffect for data loading" artifact
4. This new code:
   - Detects the correct period from the index methodology
   - Loads the corresponding job trends file
   - Adds the top_augmented_roles and top_automated_roles directly to the index data

### Step 2: Enhance the Role Processing Function

1. Find the `processRolesDataForSplitBars` function in your `AILaborMarketDashboard.jsx` file
2. Replace it with the code from the "Fix for processRolesDataForSplitBars function" artifact
3. Add the `titleCase` helper function shown in the artifact
4. This improved function:
   - Handles raw occupation automation data (from the Anthropic raw files)
   - Processes top_augmented_roles and top_automated_roles arrays
   - Falls back to statistics-based generation when needed

### Step 3: Fix the Job Role Processing Logic

1. Find the section in your component that processes job roles data (around line 600-635)
2. Replace this section with the code from the "AILaborMarketDashboard.jsx Fix" artifact
3. This updated code:
   - Checks multiple sources for role data
   - Properly identifies Anthropic Economic Index data
   - Sets the `usingDerivedRoles` flag correctly

## Testing the Fix

After implementing these changes:

1. Test the dashboard locally to ensure it's correctly displaying the March 2025 data
2. Verify that the "Using derived data" notice no longer appears
3. Check the browser console for any errors or warnings

## Data File Considerations

If you've already applied the timestamp fixes from our previous discussion:

1. Your raw data files should be correctly labeled as 2025-03 (March data)
2. The job trends file should be renamed from `job_trends_202504.json` to `job_trends_202503.json`
3. The index methodology data_sources should point to the correct file names

## Next Steps

Consider adding additional error logging to help diagnose similar issues in the future:

```javascript
// Example error logging for data processing
if (!jobData.top_augmented_roles || !jobData.top_automated_roles) {
  console.warn('Job data missing expected properties: ', {
    hasAugmentedRoles: !!jobData.top_augmented_roles,
    hasAutomatedRoles: !!jobData.top_automated_roles,
    dataSource: jobData.source,
    availableProperties: Object.keys(jobData)
  });
}
```

This would give you more specific information when the expected data structure isn't found.
