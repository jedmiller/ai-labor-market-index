# Anthropic Economic Index Integration Plan - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

## Project Overview

This document outlines the completed implementation of replacing the Job Trends component of the AI Labor Market Impact Index with data from the Anthropic Economic Index. This transition improves the quality and representativeness of our labor market analysis by incorporating empirical data from millions of AI interactions across diverse economic tasks.

## Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Processing ✅

1. Created `scripts/collection/collect_anthropic_index.py` that:
   - Fetches data from Hugging Face repository
   - Handles simulation mode for testing and development
   - Provides fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Transforms CSV data to the required JSON format

2. Created `scripts/processing/process_anthropic_index.py` that:
   - Processes the raw Anthropic data into job trends format
   - Extracts key metrics (automation rates, augmentation rates)
   - Identifies top automated and augmented roles
   - Produces standardized output for the index calculator

### Phase 2: Index Calculation Integration ✅

1. Modified `scripts/analysis/calculate_index.py` to:
   - Add a dedicated method `calculate_anthropic_index_score()`
   - Incorporate automation/augmentation ratios in index calculation
   - Balance metrics between augmentation (positive) and automation (negative)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with legacy data format

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration ✅

1. Updated `scripts/sync_github_data.py` to:
   - Include Anthropic data collection in the monthly workflow
   - Process Anthropic data after collection
   - Sync Anthropic data files with GitHub
   - Maintain legacy job collection for backward compatibility

## Data Flow

The complete data flow now works as follows:

1. **Collection**: The collection scripts gather data from various sources
   - `collect_anthropic_index.py` - Anthropic Economic Index data (primary source)
   - `collect_arxiv.py` - Research paper data
   - `collect_bls.py` - Employment statistics
   - `collect_news.py` - Workforce events
   - Legacy `collect_jobs.py` - Maintained for backward compatibility

2. **Processing**: The processing scripts transform raw data
   - `process_anthropic_index.py` - Creates job trends from Anthropic data
   - `process_employment.py` - Processes BLS statistics
   - `process_research.py` - Analyzes research trends
   - `process_news.py` - Extracts workforce events
   - Legacy `process_jobs.py` - Maintained for backward compatibility

3. **Analysis**: The analysis script calculates the index
   - `calculate_index.py` - Combines all components with appropriate weights
   - Uses `calculate_anthropic_index_score()` method for job trends

4. **Synchronization**: The sync script coordinates workflow
   - `sync_github_data.py` - Orchestrates collection, processing, and GitHub sync
   - Supports year/month parameters for historical data collection

## Scheduling

The Anthropic Index data collection is now fully aligned with the existing scheduled workflows:

1. All data sources use the same year/month parameters
2. The collection sequence ensures data consistency
3. Processing occurs in the correct order
4. The index calculation incorporates all data sources

## Testing and Verification

The implementation includes:

1. **Simulation Mode**: For testing without API access
   - Enable with `--simulation=yes` parameter
   - Uses realistic synthetic data in the simulation directory

2. **Robust Column Detection**: For reliable CSV file parsing
   - Handles variations in column naming
   - Provides clear error logs for debugging

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: For graceful degradation
   - Falls back to simulation if API is unavailable
   - Handles missing or incomplete data

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the complete workflow with real Anthropic data
2. **Dashboard Enhancement**: Update visualizations to showcase Anthropic insights
3. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with new data source information
4. **Phase-out Planning**: Develop timeline for retiring legacy job collection
