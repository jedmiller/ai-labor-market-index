We begin by teaching the next billion people English, Spanish, and French.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to\u00a0<em>speak</em>\u00a0a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help \u2013 you need to actually\u00a0<em>converse</em>\u00a0with someone.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation,\u00a0<em>without</em>\u00a0needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go.
