A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $85+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, Pepsi, Walmart, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/Insight/Tiger/etc.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.

Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-perfect credit scores or no scores at all. We decided this just wouldn\u2019t do.</p>\n<p>In partnership with our sponsor banks, we offer credit cards under the Mission Lane brand name, with better, clearer terms, and a more refined customer experience than the alternatives available to people working hard to improve their credit.</p>\n<p>To date, over three million consumers have chosen Mission Lane, earning high customer ratings on Credit Karma for its market segment and industry leading Net Promoter scores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mission Lane has cumulatively raised over $600 million of equity from leading investors, including Invus Opportunities, QED Investors, LL Funds, funds affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management, and other leading investors.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more?

Our approach spans a spectrum of temporal scales, from real-time and annual forecasts to projections spanning the next century. This comprehensive perspective on risk, coupled with our capacity to transfer risks to capital markets via catastrophe bonds, positions us to significantly contribute to enhanced climate mitigation, resilience, and equity.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">And we need you.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>What you will do</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>If you build it, data will come: </em>you'll help us put in place a system where data can travel easily from the capture point to the warehouse and through transformation processes to become useful information. Your superpowers will be put to use in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable data pipelines and ETL processes to ingest, transform, and store large volumes of data. In addition, you'll build and optimise data models, databases, and data catalogs to support retrieval needs.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>A sum of many parts</em>: you'll constantly be on the lookout for ways to make cleaner, more accurate data. This includes fixing any broken or outdated parts of the pipeline, as well as identifying and resolving performance and scalability issues in data processing and storage systems. But you won't be alone in troubleshooting; you'll collaborate with great data scientists, developers, and scientists at Mitiga to understand data requirements and translate them into technical solutions.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You're picky about quality</em>: you understand that quality is paramount when it comes to using and scaling the use of data. You'll implement data governance and data quality frameworks to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of our data. Additionally, you'll stay up to date with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and trends in data engineering and analytics to continuously push the envelope at Mitiga.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Sharing the knowledge:</em> you'll generously share your wealth of knowledge and experience by mentoring and providing technical guidance to junior members of the data engineering team. You'll also actively participate in code reviews and promote coding standards and best practices within the team.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your expertise stems from a B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related data field. You're a pro at orchestration, including containers like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as tools like Terraform, GitHub CI/CD, Git, and Jenkins. Plus, your impressive experience extends to pipeline tools like Argo, Airflow, Prefect or CVD. You have been working with APIs and offering data to clients and partners.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Python and multidimensional data processing libraries like xarray, along with parallelisation libraries such as dask and mpi, are second nature to you. And of course, you're fluent in English!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your love for learning drives you to embrace new and challenging areas. You're a team player who thrives on collaborating and building cool stuff with your teammates. The fast-paced, results-oriented culture of a startup excites you, and you're no stranger to agile methodologies (hello, Jira). You share our mission goals and always strive to deliver top-notch solutions of the highest quality and on time.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you're ready to bring your skills and attitude to our team, we'd love to hear from you!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Diversity</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A recent study shows that one in every 10 tech workers in Spain are women. Only 8% of all contracts in 2019 with people with disabilities were in technology and science. Meanwhile, 30% of LGTBIQ people in Spain do not come out in the workplace for fear of discrimination.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is neither the world we want to live in nor the workplace we\u2019re building.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Mitiga is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In fact, we strongly encourage applicants from minority groups to apply.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Our offer</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our vision is to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay and do their best work.

With 75 to 90% of a district budget dedicated to personnel, there are few questions more paramount than how your staff and students spend their time every day, what positions you need, how many teachers you will hire, and how students will interact with them. Strategic resource allocation across schools, proper access to core courses and electives, and dedicated support to sub-groups begins with the development of a school schedule.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Timely is your home for secondary scheduling featuring AI optimization and support from a team of former educators who know and have lived scheduling.
