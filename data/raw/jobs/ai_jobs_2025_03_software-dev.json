A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives.

The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth.

      "description": "<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Description</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Our mission</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Climate change is causing deep uncertainty at all levels of society, with climate volatility reducing the security of all land-based assets and posing a multi-level security threat for the functioning of enterprises, societies, and governments.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Mitiga is a spinoff of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which hosts MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Mitiga's mission is firmly rooted in employing cutting-edge science and technology to mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate-driven perils. Our approach spans a spectrum of temporal scales, from real-time and annual forecasts to projections spanning the next century. This comprehensive perspective on risk, coupled with our capacity to transfer risks to capital markets via catastrophe bonds, positions us to significantly contribute to enhanced climate mitigation, resilience, and equity.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">And we need you.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>What you will do</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>If you build it, data will come: </em>you'll help us put in place a system where data can travel easily from the capture point to the warehouse and through transformation processes to become useful information. Your superpowers will be put to use in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable data pipelines and ETL processes to ingest, transform, and store large volumes of data. In addition, you'll build and optimise data models, databases, and data catalogs to support retrieval needs.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>A sum of many parts</em>: you'll constantly be on the lookout for ways to make cleaner, more accurate data. This includes fixing any broken or outdated parts of the pipeline, as well as identifying and resolving performance and scalability issues in data processing and storage systems. But you won't be alone in troubleshooting; you'll collaborate with great data scientists, developers, and scientists at Mitiga to understand data requirements and translate them into technical solutions.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>You're picky about quality</em>: you understand that quality is paramount when it comes to using and scaling the use of data. You'll implement data governance and data quality frameworks to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of our data. Additionally, you'll stay up to date with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and trends in data engineering and analytics to continuously push the envelope at Mitiga.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Sharing the knowledge:</em> you'll generously share your wealth of knowledge and experience by mentoring and providing technical guidance to junior members of the data engineering team. You'll also actively participate in code reviews and promote coding standards and best practices within the team.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your expertise stems from a B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related data field. You're a pro at orchestration, including containers like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as tools like Terraform, GitHub CI/CD, Git, and Jenkins. Plus, your impressive experience extends to pipeline tools like Argo, Airflow, Prefect or CVD. You have been working with APIs and offering data to clients and partners.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Python and multidimensional data processing libraries like xarray, along with parallelisation libraries such as dask and mpi, are second nature to you. And of course, you're fluent in English!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your love for learning drives you to embrace new and challenging areas. You're a team player who thrives on collaborating and building cool stuff with your teammates. The fast-paced, results-oriented culture of a startup excites you, and you're no stranger to agile methodologies (hello, Jira). You share our mission goals and always strive to deliver top-notch solutions of the highest quality and on time.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you're ready to bring your skills and attitude to our team, we'd love to hear from you!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Diversity</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A recent study shows that one in every 10 tech workers in Spain are women. Only 8% of all contracts in 2019 with people with disabilities were in technology and science. Meanwhile, 30% of LGTBIQ people in Spain do not come out in the workplace for fear of discrimination.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is neither the world we want to live in nor the workplace we\u2019re building.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Mitiga is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In fact, we strongly encourage applicants from minority groups to apply.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Our offer</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our vision is to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay and do their best work. Some of our benefits, like unlimited personal time or flexible working arrangements, help work adjust to your life \u2013 and not the other way around. You can work from home or come twice a week to our office in the heart of Barcelona. Dogs and other furry friends are welcome!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our compressed work schedule allows you to work half a day on Fridays during the year (so you can start the weekend early). During the summer, it also allows you to work 4 days a week, so you spend time with your loved ones (or work on your tan). Shadow our leadership and participate in our structured feedback and mentorship programs. If you grow, we grow.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Don't see a fitting open role?
