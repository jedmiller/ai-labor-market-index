In turn, the increase in blood product donations improves a supply level that is at an all time low, and allows for blood-product derived biotherapies to continue to evolve, improve, and save lives for those who face life-threatening conditions (i.e. immune deficiencies and blood disorders). Without an increase in blood product donations, we are facing a worldwide health crisis that ultimately results in rationing of care without the proper resources.
