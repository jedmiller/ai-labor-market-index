Our Studio application enables customers to orchestrate, segment, personalize, target, and analyze these experiences across their entire user base.

We test with Jest and Playwright and document our components in Storybook.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Every engineer is given ample opportunity to learn the Appcues product and codebase, with regular opportunities to research and experiment including internal hackathons.\u00a0 Many contribute across our stack, including our Elixir on AWS backend services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the Role</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Our fully remote engineering and product team currently has over 30 people comprised of five small cross-functional teams. We are looking to hire a Senior. Frontend Engineer for our In-Product Messaging team, which today has five Senior/Staff/Principal Engineers, as well as a product manager, designer and QA engineer.

When you are ready, you\u2019ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review. Each team builds, tests and releases multiple times a day using Circle CI pipelines and test automation.</li>\n<li style=\"\">You\u2019ll collaborate with frontend engineers across all teams to maintain and improve our JavaScript and CSS codebase and the libraries we leverage. You\u2019ll work with designers and other engineers to create scalable design systems and reusable, interactive components.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">You\u2019ll collaborate with product, customer success, technical support, and sales to translate customer needs into quality code and delightful UX.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\">You will be involved in all development stages, including discovery and user-testing of new features and products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About You</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">You have been the engineering lead on significant features.

This range is for all US-based candidates and is built to be competitive nationwide by utilizing ranges for the Greater Boston area, regardless of where in the US an employee lives (or later relocates).

A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives.

The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Come work with us!</strong></div>\n<p>Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U.

Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the \"at-will\" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.</p>\n<p><strong>Recruitment Phishing Scams:</strong></p>\n<p>Fake job advertisements and offers are increasingly appearing on the internet.
