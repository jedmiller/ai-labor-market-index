A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $85+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.

As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

On Scout, you get a more relevant and growthful interviewing experience, you receive feedback on your performance, and you also get end-to-end support to improve your chances of getting hired.</p>\n<p>If you perform well on the Scout interview, you become eligible for opportunities with all companies in the Scout network (only complete the interview once).</p>\n<p><strong>This role is with our partner company that is actively hiring:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sparkwise</strong></p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>About the company</strong></div>\n<p>Hi, I'm Ari, co-founder and CTO at <a href=\"https://sparkwise.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sparkwise</a>. I've spent 20+ years building learning environments for different learning contexts, and am now focused on supporting transformational learning in the workplace. At Sparkwise, we started with a virtual learning experience that centers collaboration and human connection, and engineered platform and program management tools that can scale to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. We're happy to share that we're looking to bring on a new core member to our engineering team. In this full-stack engineering role, you'll help design, build, and shape the future of product engineering at Sparkwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>\n<p>The world is getting faster, faster. To succeed, organizations are pouring in trillions of dollars to adopt new technologies, upskill their people, and transform their teams.</p>\n<p>But it's hard to build new skills, mindsets, and behaviors at scale. Digital content doesn't engage, high-touch live learning can't scale, and AI-only tools lack human connection.</p>\n<p>At Sparkwise, our mission is to scale the best way humans learn and transform by automating McKinsey-caliber collaborative capability building, enabled by AI. Our tech facilitates real-time problem solving, collaboration, and practice in small groups \u2014 without the need for live facilitators. Companies use our platform to teach skills, instill excellence, harness collective intelligence, drive change, and more.</p>\n<p>Our clients include world-class organizations such as Harvard Business Publishing, Google, top consulting firms, and more.

      "description": "<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Allium makes blockchain data accurate, simple and fast</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Blockchain data is hard, messy, and chaotic</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">When we started out in late 2021 our thesis was simple - blockchain data, despite it being public and free, was difficult to understand, clunky to access and troublesome to maintain. Answering a simple question like <em>\u201cWho are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?\u201d</em> requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Accessing data is hard because blockchains are optimized for Writes and not Reads</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Why is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Parsing and interpreting blockchain data requires both deep domain expertise and data manipulation</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>\u201cBlockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.\u201d</u></em></a> \u00a0They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Allium abstracts the complexity with a simple way to query blockchain data</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Allium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we\u2019ve archived across 40+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Google and Bloomberg had to organize the world's public financial and webpage data, Allium is on a mission to do the same for blockchain data</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry\u2019s most exciting trends:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About our customers</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We serve 2 groups of customers today with the same data but different platform. <strong>Analysts</strong> who need to answer data questions about the blockchain (think BI) and <strong>Engineers</strong> who need highly reliable data queryable in near realtime (think Application backends).

Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow.\u00a0I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (<em>cough Man United fan</em>s) of inconsistency</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Figure It Out &amp; Extreme Ownership</strong> - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don\u2019t know it, learn it. If you can\u2019t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can\u2019t find someone, find someone who can find someone.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>High Agency</strong> - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you\u2019re looking for a superpower, you can\u2019t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Leading from the Front </strong>- No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It\u2019s one thing to say <em>We need to do XYZ this better </em>&amp; it\u2019s another thing to build an MVP and say <em>\u201cThis is the way we should do things\u201d. </em>The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) </strong>It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Sense of (allium) business smell</strong> - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\u00a0</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About the team</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We invite people of all backgrounds (<a href=\"https://www.allium.so/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.allium.so/about</a>).
