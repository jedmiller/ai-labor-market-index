Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company\u2019s recent growth:</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Hopper sells billion\u00a0worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our fintech products \u2013 including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance \u2013 have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"http://1.6x/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1.6x</a> more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">\u00a0Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper\u2019s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.\u00a0</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Featured in Apple\u2019s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research.

Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things \u2014 through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don\u2019t actually do a whole lot, they\u2019re kind of just there. They don\u2019t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more \u2014 it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.<br><br>To accomplish this lofty task, we\u2019re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences.

All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U.

Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the \"at-will\" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.</p>\n<p><strong>Recruitment Phishing Scams:</strong></p>\n<p>Fake job advertisements and offers are increasingly appearing on the internet.

Our research informs short- and long-term strategy for advancing progressive causes and has a trusted track record among key decision makers.</p>\n<p>The team has a storied history and has worked with central players to develop strategy and direct hundreds of millions of dollars of resources. The work produced by Blue Rose Research is widely regarded as among the most technically sophisticated in the space. If you join us, you\u2019ll be plugging into a diverse team of decorated engineers, data scientists and political analysts who are closely connected to some of the most important decision makers in the progressive ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We are looking for a data scientist to help develop applied statistical models and own end-to-end ML pipelines that enable us to quickly and precisely measure the effectiveness of messages from randomized controlled experiments. This role requires full-stack data science skills, and will closely collaborate with our interdisciplinary team to scope technical needs, contribute new functionality to our machine learning framework, wrangle messy data and write ETL, train and iterate on models, and own modeling output that will be delivered to client-facing stakeholders.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re a fast and dynamic team, and you\u2019ll be contributing to innovative work that evolves week by week. We\u2019re looking for you to bring your passion for data science, a strong attention to detail, and a desire to make a big impact \u2014 sometimes under tight timelines.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We offer a competitive salary, medical, dental, and health benefits, and a work environment that will support your differences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the work is remote, we do have an office in NYC and a number of team members who work in-person regularly.
