We are a technical publisher and learning provider with over 400 staff based across the globe, primarily in India and the UK. Our products have global relevance, and our multimedia portfolio includes over 7,000 books, e-books, audiobooks, and video courses.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more details, visit <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.packtpub.com</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Role Overview\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As an editor in a vertical, you will work in partnership with content creators to create high-quality products on time, according to the publishing plan. You own the product\u2019s quality, working with the content creator and other internal stakeholders from the first idea, through the outline, to the delivery of the first draft of the content and on to publication.\u202fThe goal of editorial is to raise the revenue performance of every product in every vertical by understanding content creator and user needs and the market we're publishing into.\u202f\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are responsible for ensuring that the product\u2019s vision is executed. You will ensure that products adhere to guidelines and provide enough depth and detail for the intended audience. You need to ensure that the product meets its specifications in the outline and that it is of high quality, signing off all content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The role is ideal for critical thinkers who can identify and articulate weaknesses in a product's organization and writing, using excellent English-language skills. You will adopt a coaching and mentoring role with content creators, using firm but diplomatic communication to help them shape their product, creating engaging technical content that allows readers to easily learn about new technologies and develop new skills.\u202f\u202f\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each vertical will also have a unique mix of product types. The editor will, in addition to the above, work on different product types to ensure they all meet the standards expected by our customers. These product types may be derived products, such as an audiobook or course based on a book. They may be new products created through market and user research.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demands strong competitive immersion from editors: you will develop a deep understanding of the technical publishing market and competitive landscape. To do this you will have to seek customer feedback throughout the editorial process and apply this during your edits. It is vital you keep track of new tech releases and user trends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptability and Evolving Role Requirements in Packt's Vertical Structure\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Packt\u2019s move to verticals, bringing our teams closer to users, is a response to significant changes in the market. Due to AI, self-publishing, and multi-format options, the nature of the work and the business of publishing are changing. This is not just for Packt, but for the whole industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whereas in the past we had atomized and specialist roles in a single-format product lifecycle (e.g. development editor and acquisition editor for books), in the future we will need to be agile and flexible, prepared to adapt and stretch our skills and knowledge to new products and services. Each vertical team will evolve over time towards the offering and product suite that best serves its users. Vertical teams, and the work they do, will adapt accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Examples of the agility we are looking for: in roles related to publishing, you will not only be working on books but also on other content formats that fit the preferences of your users (newsletter, live events, etc.). You may have a different team structure and line manager in your vertical vs other verticals. You will be open to taking on stretch projects and undertaking tests to evolve new product types. You\u2019ll get proactively involved in team meetings so that you can contribute your ideas alongside the rest of the vertical team. Whatever role you are in you will be expected to connect with users and experts in your vertical, and to sustain ongoing relationships that provide value. This in turn means developing a level of domain knowledge in the technology and user roles in your vertical.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In summary, the above means that a critical \u2018power skill\u2019 in the new Packt organization will be adaptability and flexibility \u2013 the ability to adjust quickly to changing circumstances and new challenges while remaining effective and open to different approaches.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only those with the willingness to adapt and flex in this new world should apply!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What You Will Do\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Editorial:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Evaluate and improve ideas and outlines, based on product reviews, Jobs-to-be-Done insights, and user interviews.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">On-board content creators and give detailed feedback on their content to allow products to proceed through the writing process.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Provide a content health check for the portfolio director to facilitate accurate planning and time allocation.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Continually assess the content in the product ensuring that the content contains all the required information according to the outline, as well as identifying and removing irrelevant content.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Identify opportunities for content creators to improve organization, presentation, clarity and value.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Make substantive edits: ensure that the structure, content, language, style and presentation of the content creator\u2019s work are suitable for its intended purpose and readership; check for sentence complexity, conciseness and clear, logical development of ideas.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Carry out user research and market analysis to elevate your editing.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Work with technical reviewers to ensure technical accuracy of the content and code.
