These are often converted into 20+ page PDFs, with handwritten (doctor\u2019s handwriting!) notes, in thousands of different formats. The problem is so complex that a person has to read it, type it up, and manually enter your information.

      "description": "<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Overview</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ambrook\u2019s mission is to help American family-run businesses become more profitable and resilient.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">In the face of historic heat waves, drought, flooding, supply chain disruptions, water shortages, and pollution, climate impacts are intensifying across industrial America: from farmers facing crop losses, to truckers navigating fuel volatility, to contractors managing material shortages. Evidence shows sustainable practice upgrades deliver financial returns \u2013 from water-efficient irrigation to fuel-efficient fleets \u2013 but these changes require significant upfront capital and a clear proof of return-on-investment to owner-operators facing tight cashflows and razor-thin margins already. With data scattered across paper records and outdated systems, operators struggle to forecast whether a practice change will improve their bottom line \u2013 let alone prove business health to lenders and other funders.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ambrook is solving this chicken-and-egg problem by re-architecting the financial data layer of America's independent businesses. We're replacing unruly paperwork and expensive, archaic tools with an affordable accounting, banking and payments platform that helps operators understand their numbers and access capital for sustainable transitions.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ambrook customers are our economy\u2019s historic backbone and a manifestation of the American Dream. Done right, both financial and environmental sustainability enables these entities to stay independent and resilient in the face of climate-driven volatility.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re starting by building for farmers and ranchers across America.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We\u2019re a Series A startup backed by top investors (Thrive Capital, Dylan Field, Homebrew, Designer Fund, BoxGroup, and more) and are looking for early team members who are ready to untangle the knotted intersection between American industry and climate.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Learn more about our mission and what it\u2019s like to work with us.</p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>The Opportunity</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ambrook is built in partnership with the people we serve. We have logged countless hours in the field learning how financial decisions get made \u2013 all in the context of real life, on the ground. We sit with the folks who support them \u2013 accountants, bankers, and funding program managers. We attend industry group meetings to stay close to what communities of operators care about. These connections shape our product and build deep empathy across our team.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As our customer base grows, we need to increase our capacity to bring these stories to a wider audience. We\u2019re hiring a <strong>Field Storyteller</strong> to capture and share the work of farmers, ranchers, and small business owners across America and contextualize Ambrook\u2019s impact.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">You\u2019ll travel to customer operations, document their stories through video and photography, and turn those moments into content that connects with audiences. You\u2019ll serve as the face of Ambrook on the road and for many, be the impression that deepens their loyalty in our brand. You\u2019ll report to our Creative Director and work across customer success, sales, and product marketing to repackage and share these stories widely in various form factors that engage our different audiences.</p><div class=\"h1\"><strong>What You\u2019ll Own</strong></div><div class=\"h2\"><strong>Story capture in the field:</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Travel to customer operations across the country to document their work through video, photography, and short-form interviews \u2013 capturing authentic, unscripted moments that bring their stories to life.</p><div class=\"h2\"><strong>Being the face of Ambrook:</strong></div><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ensure customers feel supported, seen, and celebrated throughout the storytelling process \u2013 from the

      "description": "<p><strong>Reporting to\u00a0- Portfolio Director\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>About Packt</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Packt's mission is to help the world put software to work in new ways, through the delivery of effective learning and information services to IT professionals. We are a technical publisher and learning provider with over 400 staff based across the globe, primarily in India and the UK. Our products have global relevance, and our multimedia portfolio includes over 7,000 books, e-books, audiobooks, and video courses.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>For more details, visit <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.packtpub.com</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Role Overview\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>As an editor in a vertical, you will work in partnership with content creators to create high-quality products on time, according to the publishing plan. You own the product\u2019s quality, working with the content creator and other internal stakeholders from the first idea, through the outline, to the delivery of the first draft of the content and on to publication.\u202fThe goal of editorial is to raise the revenue performance of every product in every vertical by understanding content creator and user needs and the market we're publishing into.\u202f\u00a0</p>\n<p>You are responsible for ensuring that the product\u2019s vision is executed. You will ensure that products adhere to guidelines and provide enough depth and detail for the intended audience. You need to ensure that the product meets its specifications in the outline and that it is of high quality, signing off all content.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The role is ideal for critical thinkers who can identify and articulate weaknesses in a product's organization and writing, using excellent English-language skills. You will adopt a coaching and mentoring role with content creators, using firm but diplomatic communication to help them shape their product, creating engaging technical content that allows readers to easily learn about new technologies and develop new skills.\u202f\u202f\u00a0</p>\n<p>Each vertical will also have a unique mix of product types. The editor will, in addition to the above, work on different product types to ensure they all meet the standards expected by our customers. These product types may be derived products, such as an audiobook or course based on a book. They may be new products created through market and user research.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>This demands strong competitive immersion from editors: you will develop a deep understanding of the technical publishing market and competitive landscape. To do this you will have to seek customer feedback throughout the editorial process and apply this during your edits. It is vital you keep track of new tech releases and user trends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Adaptability and Evolving Role Requirements in Packt's Vertical Structure\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Packt\u2019s move to verticals, bringing our teams closer to users, is a response to significant changes in the market. Due to AI, self-publishing, and multi-format options, the nature of the work and the business of publishing are changing. This is not just for Packt, but for the whole industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whereas in the past we had atomized and specialist roles in a single-format product lifecycle (e.g. development editor and acquisition editor for books), in the future we will need to be agile and flexible, prepared to adapt and stretch our skills and knowledge to new products and services. Each vertical team will evolve over time towards the offering and product suite that best serves its users. Vertical teams, and the work they do, will adapt accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Examples of the agility we are looking for: in roles related to publishing, you will not only be working on books but also on other content formats that fit the preferences of your users (newsletter, live events, etc.). You may have a different team structure and line manager in your vertical vs other verticals. You will be open to taking on stretch projects and undertaking tests to evolve new product types. You\u2019ll get proactively involved in team meetings so that you can contribute your ideas alongside the rest of the vertical team. Whatever role you are in you will be expected to connect with users and experts in your vertical, and to sustain ongoing relationships that provide value. This in turn means developing a level of domain knowledge in the technology and user roles in your vertical.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In summary, the above means that a critical \u2018power skill\u2019 in the new Packt organization will be adaptability and flexibility \u2013 the ability to adjust quickly to changing circumstances and new challenges while remaining effective and open to different approaches.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only those with the willingness to adapt and flex in this new world should apply!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>What You Will Do\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Editorial:\u00a0</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Evaluate and improve ideas and outlines, based on product reviews, Jobs-to-be-Done insights, and user interviews.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">On-board content creators and give detailed feedback on their content to allow products to proceed through the writing process.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Provide a content health check for the portfolio director to facilitate accurate planning and time allocation.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Continually assess the content in the product ensuring that the content contains all the required information according to the outline, as well as identifying and removing irrelevant content.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Identify opportunities for content creators to improve organization, presentation, clarity and value.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Make substantive edits: ensure that the structure, content, language, style and presentation of the content creator\u2019s work are suitable for its intended purpose and readership; check for sentence complexity, conciseness and clear, logical development of ideas.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Carry out user research and market analysis to elevate your editing.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Work with technical reviewers to ensure technical accuracy of the content and code.
