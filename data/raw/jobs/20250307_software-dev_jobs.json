A\u00b7Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A\u00b7Teamers earn $85+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A\u00b7Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $90-$150+/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A\u00b7Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere.

      "description": "<p><strong>Lead Engineer, Common Voice</strong></p>\n<p>The Mozilla Foundation is a California nonprofit public-benefit organization. Our mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to all! Today, this includes making sure artificial intelligence (AI) and data driven technology are more trustworthy.</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, the majority of our internet health programs will be on ensuring more trustworthy AI. For us, this means two things: human agency is a core part of how AI is built and integrated and corporate accountability is real and implemented. As part of this effort, we are exploring projects that invite the public to participate in creating trustworthy AI by willingly creating and donating data.</p>\n<p>Most significantly, this includes the Common Voice project, which aims to shape the future of voice AI! Voice AI leaves most languages, accents and demographics behind. This project seeks to build openly available data sets for training machine-learning driven voice technologies. The core of this project is a platform that supports language communities and individual volunteers to \u201cdonate their voice\u201d to an open data set, which anyone can then download for commercial or non-commercial use.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Responsibilities and experience:</strong></div>\n<p>The Lead Engineer for Common Voice will be part of a team of three engineers working directly for the project - and as this project is open source, also supported by hundreds of passionate Common Voice volunteers.
