In turn, the increase in blood product donations improves a supply level that is at an all time low, and allows for blood-product derived biotherapies to continue to evolve, improve, and save lives for those who face life-threatening conditions (i.e. immune deficiencies and blood disorders). Without an increase in blood product donations, we are facing a worldwide health crisis that ultimately results in rationing of care without the proper resources.

Packed with intuitive functionality, CompanyCam facilitates unparalleled communication and accountability across a contractor\u2019s entire business. We\u2019re committed to providing a consumer-grade, game-changing experience that helps our users build trust within their company and with their customers.</p>\n<p>But don\u2019t let that corporate description fool you\u2014the people behind our buttoned-up product are laid-back (but hardworking), genuine, and kickass, and you could be one of them!\u00a0</p></div><div class=\"h2\"><strong>What We Care About</strong></div>\n<p><strong>One Team:</strong> We don't think of ourselves as \"Product Managers\", \"Engineers\", \"Data Analysts\", or \"Acquisition Marketers\". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have the necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER \u2013 getting the right people with the right context, in the right rooms(Zooms) to solve problems holistically.</p>\n<p><strong>We question everything and are precious about nothing:</strong> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. Product Managers are not the exclusive purveyors of great ideas. We proactively source inputs from all directions. We talk to our customers regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to deliver value.</p>\n<p><strong>We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</strong> We understand that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to holistically articulate impact and advocate for prioritization.</p>\n<p><strong>We Execute For Impact:</strong> When we stick the landing, we have the opportunity to impact small business owners across the country. Our continued growth is directly correlated to the outsized value we produce for our busy customers.</p>\n<p><strong>We De-risk Assumptions:</strong> We are not beholden to ideas.

For music, it\u2019s Spotify. When thinking about Product Management, they should think of Product People. You\u2019ll own or contribute to initiatives to lead us there: playbooks, product management knowledge sharing, networking, process automation, etc.\u00a0</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Serve as an Interim Senior Product Manager</strong><span style='\"font-weight:'>. </span><span style='\"font-weight:'>We serve post-product market-fit digital-first companies ranging from series B to publicly listed. Some are category leaders and/or leverage the latest tech trends. You\u2019ll be driving complex cross-functional initiatives in B2C or B2B products. It can be anything from setting and reaching quarterly OKRs at a scale-up to Continuous Discovery/Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) or A/B tests elsewhere. Or unblocking stuck initiatives.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Solve for the clients and our company.</strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> </span><strong>Prioritize, zoom in and out. </strong><span style='\"font-weight:'>Make an incredible impact, bring clarity in chaos, and orchestrate flawless execution. Manage discovery and delivery for three parallel streams (internally and externally). You are good at unglamorous hands-on work and strategy. You understand how deep or wide you need to go when that\u2019s the case and when it\u2019s not.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Effectively manage various groups consisting of strong personalities</strong><span style='\"font-weight:'>. Adapt to their communication preferences. Integrate quickly and feel part of any team in days, not weeks. People love working with you and would work with you again despite you saying \u201cno\u201d to them a lot.\u00a0 Always come off as friendly, helpful, and accommodating, even when pushing back on irrational demands.</span></li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Communicate</strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> </span><strong>a compelling narrative about the product.</strong><span style='\"font-weight:'> And each existing or potential feature/capability you manage: \"What job/problem does it solve?\", \"For whom?\", \"How big is the problem/market?\", \"What is success?\" and why solving this matters in the first place. Understand, share, and shape strategic or business context with the client\u2019s CPO/VP/Director/Head of Product.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Coach the next generation of PMs.</strong> Train, mentor, and delegate relentlessly to help our (Associate) Product Managers strengthen their skills. Manage 1-6 people depending on tenure, performance reviews, and career ambitions. Collaborate with 2-3 colleagues daily.

People go to the doctor too late; clients bring externals when they are already in some pain. Few clients do preventive care. You create structure from chaos. You find these adventures exciting and make this the time of your life.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Optimism as an Operating System</strong>. You have a high-happiness resting point. You handle high-pressure situations and difficult people with timely, and composed reactions. Our job is \u201chumans all the way down\u201d. No client wants to bring in a pessimistic, cynical, or attacking consultant. They expect a politely relentless and cheerful style.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Driven, Collaborative, Kind, Direct and Open Communication</strong>. People leave higher-paying jobs to work with you again. Clients you work with recommend us to other clients. We give constructive and immediate feedback to help each other grow and do excellent work for our clients. We expect that you give/accept it graciously, learn, and adapt quickly.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Context Switching Ninja.</strong> You absorb information and make decisions quickly. We won\u2019t ever have all our clients' context on internal priorities and politics. Clients will surprise you since we don\u2019t catch them at their most organized times (hyper-growth, mergers &amp; acquisitions, staff transitions). Nevertheless, you can deep dive with engineers, context switches to explain the overall idea to a stakeholder, and then switch again to explain the sequencing of the idea to senior leadership.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Commercial Leadership.</strong> You understand how companies make money and grow, know which levers to pull with a product mindset, and are pragmatic and outcome-oriented.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Compensation</strong></div>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Based on the location of tax residence and level.</strong> The exact level is defined based on the skills and knowledge demonstrated within the hiring process, which includes unbiased blind review.

Embracing \"Spread knowledge generously,\" we foster growth through weekly Sharing and Rubber Ducky sessions, a dedicated #help channel, and promoting peer mentorship. These opportunities complement the structured mentoring from line managers and mission supervisors in the Product People Trio framework. We also offer a Learning Budget to expand your Product Management knowledge.\u00a0</li>\n</ol><div class='\"content-conclusion\"'><div class='\"sc-AxiKw'>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>What Makes Us Special</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Accelerate your personal and career growth.</strong> 10x your learning and networking opportunities by being exposed to multiple companies and teams each year. We give timely, candid, and direct feedback and expect you to do the same. We run 4-month performance reviews for each person. This helps us improve the team, maintain quality of service, and proactively promote people who show sustained performance at the next level.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Amazing culture.</strong> We have a supportive, high-performance, and open culture. It starts with onboarding you well. We hire and retain the best people living our values while counseling to leave those happier elsewhere.

Our onboarding guide contains everything you need, and if you need more, there\u2019s our #help channel! We proactively share our learning with each other through sharing sessions and help each other resolve complex situations through peer mentoring.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Levels tied to compensation</strong>. Your compensation changes when your title and level change. This is not the case with other companies (e.g., someone promotes, but they don\u2019t earn more money afterward). Moreover, we offer tenure raises that are independent of levels and promotions.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Paid sabbatical accrued every 3 years.</strong> You get a paid month off every 3 years, on top of your regular holiday allowance. Take unpaid leave anytime; we\u2019ll cover your health insurance.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>[Optional] 4-day work week.</strong> Free up space and time to pursue an MBA, travel for a longer time, or just do nothing. Our default is a 5-day workweek, you can opt-in and out of a 4-day workweek with at least one month's notice to minimize the impact on the team\u2019s workload. The compensation impact is 80% of the salary in years 1-2, 85% of the salary in years 3, and 90% of the salary in years 4+.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Remote working</strong>. We work distributed first. We recommend setting up a dedicated workspace for which you can choose to expense a MacBook, external monitor, ring light, room divider, and plants. As it can sometimes get lonely, consider that you\u2019ll need to proactively schedule in-person meetings, sports, or other activities that provide a good cutoff and help you recharge after work.\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">We operate in Central European Time, and our team values effective collaboration. To ensure seamless communication and teamwork, and support a sustainable lifestyle, we accommodate a maximum time difference of +4.5 hours / -1 to -2 hours.
