With headquarters in Jackson, Wyoming, Stio draws inspiration from the surrounding Teton Range and offers product via Stio.com, catalog, growing B2B business and its Mountain Studio\u00ae retail locations.</p><p>We live and love mountain life, and as such see ourselves as caretakers of the resources that provide it. We are proud partners of Protect Our Winters and the Conservation Alliance among many other organizations. We have a strong preferred materials platform, use Bluesign\u00ae approved textiles wherever possible, audit our supply chains for best practices, and operate our workplaces responsibly.</p><p>We think that outside is the best side and that you can\u2019t improve on nature. It\u2019s good for mind, body and soul, and it\u2019s our responsibility to help enable access for all people, regardless of race, gender, beliefs, background or ability. We strive for inclusion at Stio and in our local and national communities.</p><p></p><p><strong>YOUR ROLE </strong></p><p>The Senior Marketing Analyst is a critical member of the Data &amp; Analytics team and serves as the domain expert in marketing and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels. This role owns customer lifetime value modeling which drives performance marketing spend decisions and demand-based revenue forecasting. You will work closely with the Performance Marketing team and the broader Marketing and DTC teams as their go-to data resource. This may include projects related to e-commerce, retail, merchandising, etc. Additionally, you will partner with Finance to integrate financial guardrails and business strategy into your work. This is a full-stack analyst position with an end-to-end focus: starting with the end goal of helping stakeholders make better business decisions, the Senior Marketing Analyst will work up the stack and build the data infrastructure needed to make this possible. As an early member of a growing analytics team, the Senior Marketing Analyst will have the chance to make a broad, tangible impact on our infrastructure, analysis projects, processes, and culture.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced, detail-oriented analyst who can connect what they see in the data to the bigger picture. The right candidate is someone who doesn\u2019t hesitate to sweep the floor (e.g., fix a broken Excel link), isn\u2019t afraid to question the status quo (e.g., does this metric actually measure what is intended?), and has a strong bias for tying analysis to action. We want to hear from people who would rather quickly solve a pressing business problem with simple analysis than build a sophisticated machine learning model that collects dust. A foundation of technical skills and an interest in marketing analytics are essential, but even more important is an eagerness to learn new things and a desire to drive positive progress at Stio.</p><p>This is a remote role that is part of the Finance department and reports to the Senior Business Analyst.</p><p></p><p><strong>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES </strong></p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Provide analytical support to the Performance Marketing team for direct response marketing spend allocation.

The base salary range for this role is $80,000-$90,000. It would not be typical for someone to be hired at the top end of the range for the role, as actual pay will be determined based on several factors including experience, skills and qualifications. </p><p></p><p>This job description is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all responsibilities, skills, duties, requirements, efforts, or working conditions associated with the job.

Our elevated, responsibly designed styles range from the epic to the everyday and are inspired by an ecosystem that blends natural connection and active balance.
