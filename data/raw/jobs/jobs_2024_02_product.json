In turn, the increase in blood product donations improves a supply level that is at an all time low, and allows for blood-product derived biotherapies to continue to evolve, improve, and save lives for those who face life-threatening conditions (i.e. immune deficiencies and blood disorders). Without an increase in blood product donations, we are facing a worldwide health crisis that ultimately results in rationing of care without the proper resources. Buoy Software is excited to be playing more of a role in improving the state of blood products and blood product donations.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"\">We\u2019re working alongside Join Parachute (</span><a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"http://www.joinparachute.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"\">www.joinparachute.com/</a><span style=\"\">) in the opening of small market donation centers across the country that will create local donation center careers, opportunities to donate blood products, and provide financial compensation for those donations that will have a positive economic impact in those communities.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"\">The need for blood products is growing rapidly.

Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have the necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER \u2013 getting the right people with the right context, in the right rooms(Zooms) to solve problems holistically.</p>\n<p><strong>We question everything and are precious about nothing:</strong> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. Product Managers are not the exclusive purveyors of great ideas. We proactively source inputs from all directions. We talk to our customers regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to deliver value.</p>\n<p><strong>We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</strong> We understand that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to holistically articulate impact and advocate for prioritization.</p>\n<p><strong>We Execute For Impact:</strong> When we stick the landing, we have the opportunity to impact small business owners across the country. Our continued growth is directly correlated to the outsized value we produce for our busy customers.</p>\n<p><strong>We De-risk Assumptions:</strong> We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. We constantly ask ourselves, \"What's the most important thing I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that assumption as fast as possible?\". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and constantly take in new information and adjust our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time, but by de-risking assumptions and remaining customer-focused, we tend to be pretty on target.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">How You'll Make An Impact</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Drive growth through comprehensive, end-to-end initiatives that span insight generation, experimental design, and cross-functional execution, including:\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Designing sustainable growth loops with viral product features and network effects</li>\n<li style=\"\">Leading pricing and packaging strategies through rigorous experimentation</li>\n<li style=\"\">Conducting deep-dive analyses of user behavior, conversion funnels, and retention patterns</li>\n<li style=\"\">Leveraging sophisticated statistical analysis to validate hypotheses and optimize growth levers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">Build and maintain relationships across engineering, data, design, finance, and marketing teams, proactively sharing insights and achieving cross-functional alignment</li>\n<li style=\"\">Develop and implement comprehensive growth strategies across owned channels (digital and mobile) to drive adoption and retention of new features while maintaining the highest levels of trust in the CompanyCam brand</li>\n<li style=\"\">Launch new features, build new mobile and web experiences, craft product positioning, develop business requirements, and define success metrics</li>\n<li style=\"\">Deeply understand our products and customers to build frictionless and delightful customer journeys (e.g. discovery, onboarding) that maximize adoption and retention</li>\n<li style=\"\">Build and maintain growth models to forecast the impact of various initiatives and help prioritize our roadmap</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">We\u2019re Excited About You Because</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">You bring 5+ years of growth-focused product experience, with a proven track record of driving business impact through data-driven experimentation, including:\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Pricing optimization and packaging initiatives</li>\n<li style=\"\">Designing and analyzing A/B tests</li>\n<li style=\"\">Breaking down complex problems with curiosity and analytical rigor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">You're a strategic thinker who looks around corners, thinking several steps ahead while maintaining an ability to communicate complex ideas clearly</li>\n<li style=\"\">You have strong cross-functional collaboration skills, understanding that impact comes from empowering others rather than doing <em>everything</em> yourself</li>\n<li style=\"\">Your background reflects a blend of analytical depth and product vision \u2013 whether you were a data analyst who wanted to build products or a product person with a passion for data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">You're familiar with and have used the set of practices outlined in Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres</li>\n<li style=\"\">You\u2019ve spent a good portion of your career developing consumer-facing solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">About The Growth Team</div>\n<p>We have four principles</p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Holistic thinking:</strong> We know that nothing exists in a silo</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Disciplined prioritization:</strong> We substantiate the size of the opportunity we\u2019re pursuing</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Data-driven decision-making:</strong> We use first principles and are skeptical.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Proactive collaboration:</strong> We build context together and encourage synchronous, streamlined work from our colleagues and diversity in problem-solving<br><br></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Benefits &amp; Compensation<br></strong></div>\n<p>This is a salaried position at CompanyCam.
